SVTPlay REST

This provides a REST interface to traverse the available shows and episodes 
provided by SVTPlay.

Right now, this is just the code for traversing svtplay.se. The goal is to 
build a proper server out of this, including caching data server side to avoid 
doing so many requests to the svtplay.se server.
